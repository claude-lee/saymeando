log.msg("Don't mind", logLevel=logging.DEBUG)
log.msg("This is just FYI", logLevel=logging.INFO)
log.msg("This is a no no", logLevel=logging.ERROR)
1) have sections for log chapters, product shouldn't know about test, not even logging
1) look into twisted logging create my own Logpublisher and set it in twisted.log module?
2) Have a 3pp folder and store all 3pp files there, like bencode
1) logging: in the code only state: log("The file doesn't exist, 20140619 8:44, FileNotFound Error")
1) run code with flag -logLevel = log.DEBUG for instance
1) Log different log levels
1) if DEBUG level, take the entire string, if ERROR level, take part 0 and 1 and if INFO only 0. Or something like that
